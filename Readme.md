powered by Jekyll.

Pull request guidelines: 

Add your file to the `_posts` folder. The file name format is `YYYY-MM-DD-name`, where `name` is replaced with the startup's name, all lowercase. Spaces etc. should be replaced with dashes.

Images should be 460x345px, .png format, and go in `/images/featured` with the same `name` as above.
