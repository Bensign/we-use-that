### What startups use to get stuff done.

### Pull request guidelines: 

1. Create a new post in the `_posts` folder that answers the four questions:

  - Who are you, and what do you do?
  - What is your technology stack?
  - What software do you use to run your business better?
  - What business software do you most wish existed?

  Take a look at the other posts for guidance on length etc.

  The file name format is `YYYY-MM-DD-name`, where `name` is replaced with the startup's name, all lowercase. Spaces etc. should be replaced with dashes.

2. Add an image. Images should be 460x345px, .png format, and go in `/images/featured` with the same `name` as above.
