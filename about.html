<div class="about">
  <h2 class="question">What is this?</h2>
  <p>We ask startups about their favorite tools for getting things done. We were heavily, ahem, inspired by <a href="http://usesthis.com/about/">The Setup</a>.</p>
  <h2 class="question">Can I submit my startup to be featured?</h2>
  <p>Sure! The easiest thing to do is to send us a <a href="https://github.com/weusethat/we-use-that">pull request</a>.</p>
  <h2 class="question">What's a pull request?</h2>
  <p>Are you sure you work at a startup?</p>
  <h2 class="question">No, really, how can I get on your site without learning something new?</h2>
  <p>We might build a form, eventually. Really, your best bet is to figure out the pull request thing.</p>
